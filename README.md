# renesto-random-utils

This folder contains, or rather will contain, all different kinds of small utils that I have built throughout time.

* *GPS-NMEA-Toolkit*

This one I did in MATLAB back in 2011 to get the most of the GPS sentences received from the GARMIN GPS Receiver. It stores a GPS log in separate file, as well as provides more accurate positioning (by averaging latest set of positions).
In case the features are not as I explained, I will take care in near future to correct either this description or update the code.

* *UTF8_2_ISO646DE_Convert*

This small program I made to convert the file encoded in UTF-8 to old and scarry ISO-646-DE (ASCII-DE) encoding.
